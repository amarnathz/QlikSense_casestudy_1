Instructions for Fetching and Cleaning Data from Excel Tabs
Step 1: Fetching Data
Open the Excel file attached.

There are three tabs named Tab1, Tab2, and Tab3. Each tab contains data that needs cleaning.

Step 2: Data Cleaning
Tab1:
Clean the data in Tab1 by ensuring there are no blank rows or columns.

Rename the columns as necessary.

Tab2:
Clean the data in Tab2 by removing any unnecessary rows or columns.

Ensure consistent formatting and column names.

Tab3:
Clean the data in Tab3 by removing any irrelevant rows or columns.

Standardize column names and formatting.

Step 3: Transforming into Pivot Table
For each tab (Tab1, Tab2, Tab3), create a pivot table.

Use the 'Type' column as Rows, 'MonthName' as Columns, and 'Data' as Values.

Adjust any additional settings as needed for your specific data.

Step 4: Converting to Straight Table
For each pivot table, convert it into a straight table:

In Excel, right-click on the pivot table.

Select "Convert to Range" or a similar option.

Step 5: Concatenating Tables
Load the cleaned and transformed data into Qlik Sense or any other data visualization tool.


The resulting table ConcatenatedTable will contain the cleaned and concatenated data from all three tabs in a straight table format.
